## My process

- Tried to implement semantic HTML5 markup
- For styling mostly used Flexbox with CSS Grid on few ocassions.
- Tried to make it fully responsive.

### What I learned

During this project practised React, styling and making the app fully responsive. More interesting were the tabs and navigation in this project, where I used router and state.
